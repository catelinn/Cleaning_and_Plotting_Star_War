# Overview

This is one of the guided projects in the DataQuest **Data Analysis and Visulization** course with focus on cleaning and visualization. The project is based on the 835 respnoses to the survey conducted by *FiveThirtyEight* concerning the first 6 episodes of Star War movie.

In the first project notebook, I followed the steps in the course to answer the question: ***Does most American realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of all the Star War episodes?***

In the second notebook, I used the data wrangling and visuluzation skills learned in the course to examines the favoriate or controversal characters, as well as demographic analysis on the popularity of different eposodies.
