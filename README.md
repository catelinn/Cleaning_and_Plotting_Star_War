# Clean and Explore the Star War Survey Data

This is one of the guided projects in the **Data Analysis and Visulization** which is focused on cleaning and visualization. 

The project is based on the 835 respnoses to the survey conducted by *FiveThirtyEight* concerning the first 6 Star War movies. 

In the first project notebook, I followed the steps in the course to answer the question: ***Does most America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?***

While in the second notebook, I used the data wrangling and visuluzation skills learned in the course to examines the favoriate or controversal characters, as well as demographic analysis on the popularity of different eposodies. 

# Skills applied
